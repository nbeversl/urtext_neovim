# Urtext Neovim

An implementation of Urtext in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

This is a work in progress. Contributions are invited and welcome.

## What is Urtext?

Urtext turns text notes into a live, programmable knowledge base. It parses folders of text documents into uniquely identified nodes, with built-in structure, links, timestamps, and metadata that stay inside the files. N=o database, no lock-in. Embedded Python lets you query, transform, and generate content dynamically, so writing, organizing, and automating all happen in the same place: your editor and your text.

## Installation

The repository is in the structure of a NeoVim plugin. It can be installed manually or using a package manager.
